# Installer Output
# Ignore the generated installer files from Inno Setup.
# The .iss script IS your source code and should be committed.

# Build Artifacts
# Ignore the final executable and library files directly. The bin folder rule
# already covers this, but this is an extra safeguard.

*.dll

# NuGet Packages
# Modern .NET uses a global cache, but this prevents old-style packages folders
# from being committed. The .csproj file is the source of truth for packages.

# Log and Temporary Files
# General rule to ignore log files and other temporary output.
